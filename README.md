## Overview

This project aims to provide a mode for [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) that handle the PromQL ([Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) Query Language) syntax.

### Status
This mode is **not** production ready. If you want to use it, you may encounter some parsing issue.

For the moment, the mode only proposes an offline mode with a light PromQL grammar inside. That means it is actually parsing what you are writing and will highlight some syntax error when it is possible. 
In future release, an online mode will be developed using the different feature provides by the [promQL-langserver](https://github.com/prometheus-community/promql-langserver)  

### Playground
If you want to test it, you have the last version available on the following website: 

https://nexucis.github.io/codemirror-mode-promql/

Here is a picture that display how it looks like when you write a promQL expression:

### RoadMap
Note: the following task are sorted by priority. So the last one has the less priority.

- [x] Developed an offline mode using a light promQL grammar
- [ ] Build a better development environment ( Having to copy the src folder to the example to test it is not acceptable)
  - [ ] Create a test folder in the src folder that will contain a light app that will start the codeMirror
  - [ ] Automatized test to checked that all correct promQL syntax are covered
- [ ] Implement the Online mode
- [ ] Offline mode improvement
  - [ ] Improve the error returns when a wrong promQL syntax is entered
  - [ ] Use directly the parser generated by the grammar to be able to add the check done in the [promQL parser](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/fac7a4a0504404fa5d4c5abb8fcc9750bd5cbda7/promql/parser/parse.go#L510-L515)

## Contributions
Any contribution or suggestion would be really appreciated. Feel free to use the Issue section or to send a pull request.

## Development
In case you want to contribute and change the code by yourself, an easy way to do it is to:
 * Copy all file in the folder **src** in the folder **example/angular-promql/src**
 * Modify the file main.ts and replace the line `import 'codemirror-mode-promql';` by `import './index.ts';`
 * Run `npm install` and `npm start` in the folder **example/angular-promql/src**
 
Once you modified the code of the lib, don't forget to report the changes in the tracked corresponding file :).

### Deploy to Github Page
* `npm install -g angular-cli-ghpages`
* go on examples/angular-promql
* `ng build --prod --base-href "https://nexucis.github.io/codemirror-mode-promql/"`
* `ngh -d dist/angular-promql`
